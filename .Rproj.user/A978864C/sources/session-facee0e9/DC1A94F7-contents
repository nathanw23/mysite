# Biography

I am a PhD student at the Institute for Bioengineering at the University of Edinburgh. I am based in the [Dunn Group](https://www.katherinedunnresearch.eng.ed.ac.uk/) and work on DNA nanotechnology-based methods to detect cancer biomarkers such as circulating tumour DNA. In addition to this research, I am interested in synthetic biology for biomedical applications.
