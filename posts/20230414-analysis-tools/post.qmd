As part of my PhD I've developed a suite of command line tools to automate cleanup and plotting of data related to fluorescence data. The software tools can be found on my [GitHub](https://www.github.com/nathanw23/Analysis-Tools). A web version with limited tools can be found [here](https://labanalysistools.streamlit.app/).
